# Adaptive Task Tiers Template

This template is designed to support time-flexible learning in 30-day guides by offering tiered daily tasks. Each day presents learners with multiple options based on their availability, interest, or confidence level. This approach promotes autonomy while maintaining consistent progress.

## Day X – [Title of the Day]

**Learning Objective:**  
_(What should the learner accomplish by the end of today, regardless of tier?)_

### Task Options

#### Option 1: Light (Approx. 10–15 minutes)  
**Goal:** Gain exposure or reinforce existing understanding  
**Task:**  
_(E.g., Read a short article, watch a short video, review definitions)_

#### Option 2: Standard (Approx. 20–30 minutes)  
**Goal:** Achieve today’s core learning outcome  
**Task:**  
_(E.g., Complete a hands-on activity, answer practice questions, follow a step-by-step tutorial)_

#### Option 3: Extended (Approx. 30–45+ minutes)  
**Goal:** Deepen understanding or apply learning creatively  
**Task:**  
_(E.g., Tackle a real-world challenge, apply the concept to your project, teach it to someone else)_

### Suggested Reflection (For All Learners)

_(Use a common reflection question regardless of chosen task level)_

- What was your biggest takeaway from today?
- How would you explain today’s concept to someone else?
- How confident are you in using this skill moving forward?

## Notes for Guide Creators

- You may label each task tier with icons or visual markers
- Be sure that each option supports the same objective at different depths
- Learners should be encouraged to select the task that fits their context, not feel pressured to always choose the most complex option

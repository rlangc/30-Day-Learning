# Weekly Review Prompt Cards

These pre-written reflection prompts are designed to be used at the end of each week in a 30-day learning guide. They help learners pause, process what they’ve learned, and make connections to future content or real-world applications. Prompts can be embedded directly into guide content or printed as cards for journaling or discussion.

## Week 1 Prompts – Building Foundations

- What concepts or skills did you find easiest to grasp this week? Why?
- What is one thing you struggled with that you want to revisit?
- How does what you’ve learned connect to your original learning goal?
- If you could explain one idea from this week to someone else, what would it be?

## Week 2 Prompts – Applying Core Knowledge

- What new connections did you make this week between topics or tasks?
- How did applying what you learned feel different than just learning it?
- What questions are you starting to form as the content gets deeper?
- How confident do you feel in what you’ve practiced so far?

## Week 3 Prompts – Advancing Skills

- What activity or challenge pushed you out of your comfort zone?

## Week 4 Prompts – Synthesizing and Reflecting

- What are you most proud of accomplishing in the past 30 days?

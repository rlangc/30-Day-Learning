# Self-Assessment Checklist for 30-Day Learning Guides

This checklist is designed for learners to use throughout a 30-day guide to reflect on their progress, identify areas for improvement, and track growth. It can be completed weekly or at key milestones to reinforce self-awareness and learning ownership.

## Section 1: Weekly Progress

Use the checklist below to assess your progress at the end of each week.

### Week X

- [ ] I completed all or most of the daily tasks
- [ ] I understood the main concepts introduced this week
- [ ] I applied new knowledge through exercises or reflection
- [ ] I reviewed or revisited past concepts as needed
- [ ] I asked questions or made notes about things I didn’t fully understand

**Self-Rating (1 = Struggling, 5 = Confident):**  
Knowledge: ☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5  
Consistency: ☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5  
Motivation: ☐ 1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5  

## Section 2: Skill and Concept Mastery

Rate your level of confidence in the following areas:

| Skill or Concept               | Not Yet | Somewhat | Confident |
|-------------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| [Insert Skill 1 Here]         | ☐       | ☐        | ☐         |
| [Insert Skill 2 Here]         | ☐       | ☐        | ☐         |
| [Insert Skill 3 Here]         | ☐       | ☐        | ☐         |

## Section 3: Reflection Prompts

Choose 1–2 questions to answer each week in your learning journal or reflection space.

- What did I learn this week that challenged my previous thinking?
- Which task or concept did I enjoy most? Why?
- Where did I struggle, and how can I approach it differently?
- What would success look like for me by Day 30?

## Section 4: Goal Check-In

- [ ] I am still clear on my learning goal for this guide
- [ ] I have made visible or measurable progress toward that goal
- [ ] I know what I need to do next to stay on track

## Summary

Self-assessment helps learners monitor their progress and adjust strategies along the way. Encourage completing this checklist weekly and again on Day 30 for final reflection.

# Time Commitment and Flexibility Models for 30-Day Learning Guides

Learners approach self-paced guides with different time constraints, goals, and learning preferences. Designing flexible time models helps ensure that a 30-day guide can support a wide range of users while maintaining structure and clarity. This document outlines three scalable models based on time commitment and learning depth.

## Model 1: Core Track (15–30 Minutes/Day)

**Audience:** Busy professionals, casual learners, or beginners  
**Approach:** Focused, essential learning tasks only

**Structure:**
- One core objective per day
- Minimal required reading or viewing (5–10 minutes)
- One quick practice task or reflection
- Weekly milestone is optional or lightweight

**Use Case Example:**  
A “Learn Excel Basics” guide that offers a daily video and one worksheet activity with optional practice.

## Model 2: Full Track (45–60 Minutes/Day)

**Audience:** Learners seeking depth, certification preparation, or portfolio-ready skills  
**Approach:** Blends learning and application for well-rounded development

**Structure:**
- Full lesson content (read/watch)
- Guided exercises and scenario-based tasks
- Regular reviews, quizzes, or self-checks
- Weekly milestone that requires submission or reflection

**Use Case Example:**  
A “Build Your First Power App” guide with structured learning followed by daily app-building tasks.

## Model 3: Adaptive Track (Variable Time/Day)

**Audience:** Self-directed learners or those with fluctuating availability  
**Approach:** Offers tiered task levels—choose based on available time

**Structure:**
- Each day provides 2–3 engagement levels:
  - **Light:** Basic reading or quick task
  - **Standard:** Core learning activity
  - **Extended:** Bonus content, deeper application, or enrichment task
- Weekly check-ins encourage reflection on chosen engagement level

**Use Case Example:**  
A “Design Thinking Fundamentals” guide offering optional articles, podcasts, and prototyping tasks in addition to required content.

## Tips for Implementing Flexibility

- Use icons, labels, or formatting to identify time levels clearly (e.g., "Quick Task," "Standard Path," "Bonus")
- Encourage learners to set a consistent time block based on their track
- Make optional tasks truly optional—core learning shouldn’t rely on bonus content
- Include planning templates or self-assessments to help learners commit to a time model

## Sample Daily Layout (Adaptive Model)

**Day 12 – Storyboarding for UX Design**

- **Quick Task (10 min):** Review 3 storyboarding examples
- **Standard Task (25 min):** Sketch a simple storyboard using a provided template
- **Bonus Task (45 min):** Build a clickable prototype of the storyboard using Figma

## Summary

Flexible time commitment models help accommodate different learners while preserving the benefits of a structured 30-day guide. By offering a core experience with optional depth, you can support meaningful engagement across learning styles, motivations, and availability.

# Instructional Frameworks for Self-Paced 30-Day Learning Guides

Self-paced 30-day guides benefit from strong instructional foundations that promote learner autonomy, knowledge retention, and meaningful application. This document introduces several widely used instructional design frameworks that can enhance the structure, flow, and effectiveness of your learning guide.

## ADDIE Model (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate)

A foundational framework in instructional design that helps structure and refine learning experiences.

- **Analyze**: Identify your target audience and their needs
- **Design**: Map out your 30-day structure and determine assessment points
- **Develop**: Build daily activities, content, and resources
- **Implement**: Deliver the guide in a user-friendly format (e.g., GitHub, LMS, PDF)
- **Evaluate**: Collect feedback or self-assessments for continuous improvement

**Use in a 30-Day Guide**: Apply ADDIE to create a clean workflow from planning to deployment.

## Gagné’s Nine Events of Instruction

A sequence of instructional events that align well with daily lesson design.

1. Gain attention  
2. Inform learners of objectives  
3. Stimulate recall of prior learning  
4. Present content  
5. Provide learning guidance  
6. Elicit performance (practice)  
7. Provide feedback  
8. Assess performance  
9. Enhance retention and transfer

**Use in a 30-Day Guide**: Use this model to structure individual daily entries or capstone activities.

## Bloom’s Taxonomy

A hierarchy of learning objectives that can shape the cognitive progression across a 30-day timeline.

- **Remember** → **Understand** → **Apply** → **Analyze** → **Evaluate** → **Create**

**Use in a 30-Day Guide**: Gradually increase complexity each week to move learners toward higher-order thinking and creative application.

## Self-Directed Learning Model

Rooted in adult learning theory, this model emphasizes learner control, reflection, and internal motivation.

Phases:
1. **Diagnose learning needs**
2. **Set goals**
3. **Identify resources**
4. **Choose and implement strategies**
5. **Evaluate learning outcomes**

**Use in a 30-Day Guide**: Offer planning templates, optional learning paths, and self-assessment tools that empower learners to personalize their experience.

## SAM (Successive Approximation Model)

An iterative and agile design model used for quickly prototyping and refining content.

- Emphasizes rapid development, continuous feedback, and adaptability
- Best suited for guides that evolve or are revised frequently

**Use in a 30-Day Guide**: Prototype a small batch of daily lessons, test with a small group, and refine based on user input before scaling.

## Practical Application Tips

- Use Bloom’s Taxonomy to scaffold weekly learning goals
- Structure daily tasks with Gagné’s events in mind
- Apply ADDIE during the planning and production of the guide
- Offer tools for self-reflection and goal setting from the Self-Directed Learning model
- Consider SAM if you’re iterating on the guide post-release

## Summary

Instructional frameworks help ensure that self-paced learning guides are not only engaging but pedagogically sound. Whether you follow one model or blend several, grounding your 30-day guide in proven learning theory will improve clarity, flow, and impact for your learners.

# Foundational Learning Theories – Annotated List

This annotated list introduces foundational learning theories referenced throughout various 30-day learning guides. These theories support the structure, pacing, and instructional strategies used in self-paced learning environments. Each entry includes a brief explanation and suggested resources for further reading.

## 1. Behaviorism

**Overview:**  
Behaviorism focuses on observable changes in behavior, emphasizing reinforcement and repetition. It supports task-based instruction and reward systems (e.g., progress tracking, checklists).

**Key Theorists:** B.F. Skinner, John B. Watson  
**Applications:** Drill-based practice, habit formation, feedback loops  
**Suggested Reading:**  
- Skinner, B. F. (1953). *Science and Human Behavior*  
- “Behaviorism” – Learning-Theories.com

## 2. Cognitivism

**Overview:**  
Cognitivism views learning as an internal process influenced by memory, perception, and thinking. It supports structured lesson formats, scaffolding, and review cycles.

**Key Theorists:** Jean Piaget, Robert Gagné  
**Applications:** Chunking content, cognitive load reduction, spaced repetition  
**Suggested Reading:**  
- Gagné, R. M. (1985). *The Conditions of Learning*  
- “Cognitivism” – InstructionalDesign.org

## 3. Constructivism

**Overview:**  
Constructivism emphasizes learner-driven meaning-making through experience and reflection. Learners build knowledge by connecting new information to prior understanding.

**Key Theorists:** Lev Vygotsky, Jerome Bruner  
**Applications:** Reflection prompts, open-ended projects, journal-based learning  
**Suggested Reading:**  
- Vygotsky, L. (1978). *Mind in Society*  
- Bruner, J. (1996). *The Culture of Education*

## 4. Connectivism

**Overview:**  
Connectivism addresses learning in the digital age, where knowledge is distributed across networks, communities, and tools. It supports exploration, self-direction, and learner autonomy.

**Key Theorists:** George Siemens, Stephen Downes  
**Applications:** Social learning, curation tasks, external resource integration  
**Suggested Reading:**  
- Siemens, G. (2005). *Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age*  
- “Connectivism and the Use of Technology” – International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning

## 5. Experiential Learning

**Overview:**  
Learning is seen as a process whereby knowledge is created through experience. Reflection on doing is essential to deepen understanding.

**Key Theorist:** David Kolb  
**Applications:** Project-based learning, capstone challenges, iterative design  
**Suggested Reading:**  
- Kolb, D. A. (1984). *Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development*  
- “Experiential Learning Theory” – Simply Psychology

## 6. Andragogy (Adult Learning Theory)

**Overview:**  
Adult learners are self-directed, goal-oriented, and motivated by relevance. Andragogy emphasizes autonomy, practical application, and respect for prior experience.

**Key Theorist:** Malcolm Knowles  
**Applications:** Learner choice, flexible pacing, goal setting exercises  
**Suggested Reading:**  
- Knowles, M. S. (1980). *The Modern Practice of Adult Education*  
- “Principles of Adult Learning” – University Teaching Resources

## Summary

Understanding foundational learning theories enables more intentional design of 30-day guides. These theories inform how content is delivered, how learners engage with material, and how outcomes are structured across self-paced experiences.

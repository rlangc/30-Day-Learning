# Evidence-Based Learning Practices

This resource highlights core learning strategies supported by empirical research that inform the structure and delivery of 30-day learning guides. These practices enhance learner retention, engagement, and self-efficacy—especially in self-paced, independent learning formats.

## 1. Spaced Repetition

**What It Is:**  
Spaced repetition involves reviewing content at increasing intervals to improve long-term retention.

**Evidence:**  
- Cepeda et al. (2006) found spaced practice to be significantly more effective than massed practice across multiple subjects.
- It supports durable learning and is often embedded in flashcard systems like Anki.

**Application in 30-Day Guides:**  
- Include structured review days (e.g., Day 7, 14, 21, 28).
- Reinforce key terms, summaries, or quizzes from previous weeks.

## 2. Retrieval Practice

**What It Is:**  
Retrieval practice is the act of recalling information without re-reading or rewatching. It strengthens memory and promotes deeper learning.

**Evidence:**  
- Roediger & Butler (2011) demonstrated that low-stakes quizzes and practice testing improve retention.
- Practicing recall is more effective than additional studying.

**Application in 30-Day Guides:**  
- Integrate reflection prompts and micro-quizzes.
- Use “teach-back” assignments where learners explain a topic in their own words.

## 3. Interleaving

**What It Is:**  
Interleaving mixes different topics or skills in a learning sequence rather than blocking them by type.

**Evidence:**  
- Kornell & Bjork (2008) showed that interleaving helps learners better discriminate between concepts and improves transfer.
- Especially effective for math, problem-solving, and design-based thinking.

**Application in 30-Day Guides:**  
- Alternate between content types (e.g., theory, practice, and analysis) during the week.
- Mix different domains in project-based tasks.

## 4. Dual Coding

**What It Is:**  
Combining verbal and visual content leads to stronger understanding than using either alone.

**Evidence:**  
- Paivio’s Dual Coding Theory (1986) supports the use of visuals to reinforce abstract information.
- Visuals help organize concepts, enhance engagement, and support different learning preferences.

**Application in 30-Day Guides:**  
- Include visual organizers, sketch notes, icons, and video summaries.
- Encourage learners to create diagrams or mind maps of what they've learned.

## 5. Metacognition

**What It Is:**  
Metacognition refers to “thinking about one’s thinking”—awareness and regulation of one’s learning strategies.

**Evidence:**  
- Zimmerman (2002) linked metacognitive skill development to improved self-regulation and academic performance.
- Supports motivation and self-directed learning.

**Application in 30-Day Guides:**  
- Include reflection cards, weekly check-ins, and progress tracking tools.
- Use prompts like “What do I know? What do I still need to learn?”

## Summary

These strategies are built into the 30-day format through review days, self-assessments, visual aids, and reflection prompts. Leveraging research-backed methods ensures the learning experience is not only engaging but also effective and sustainable.

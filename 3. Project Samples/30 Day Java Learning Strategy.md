    - Understand encapsulation and abstraction
    - Work with private, protected, and public access modifiers
- Day 13:
    - Learn about interfaces and abstract classes
    - Write programs implementing multiple interfaces
- Day 14:
    - Review OOP concepts with mini-projects like a library or employee management system

<h2>Week 3: Advanced Concepts</h2>

    - Learn about packages and how to organize code
    - Use built-in packages like ```java.util```
- Day 16:
    - Study exception handling and write robust programs
    - Explore ```try```, ```catch```, ```finally```, ```throw```, and ```throws```
- Day 17:
    - Dive into Java Collections Framework: lists and sets
    - Practice using ```ArrayList``` and ```HashSet```
- Day 18:
    - Explore maps and queues.
    - Use HashMap and PriorityQueue
- Day 19:
    - Understand file handling: reading from and writing to files
    - Practice with File and BufferedReader
- Day 20:
    - Learn about multithreading and concurrency basics
    - Create threads using Thread and Runnable
- Day 21:
    - Review advanced concepts with small coding exercises

<h2>Week 4: Building Projects and Beyond</h2>

- Day 22:
    - Work on a project: Create a simple calculator or a to-do list application
- Day 23:
    - Explore Java Swing/JavaFX for GUI-based applications
    - Build a simple GUI program
- Day 24:
    - Learn basic database integration using JDBC
    - Write a program connecting to a database
- Day 25:
    - Study how to work with APIs in Java
    - Make simple HTTP requests using libraries like ```HttpClient```
- Day 26:
    - Explore Lambda expressions and streams
    - Write programs with functional programming concepts
- Day 27:
    - Learn about unit testing using JUnit
    - Write and test a small class
- Day 28:
    - Begin a capstone project that combines most of the concepts
        - Examples:
            - A simple inventory management system
            - A mini banking application
- Day 29:
    - Continue and complete the capstone project
- Day 30:
    - Reflect on what you’ve learned
    - Explore additional resources like Java design patterns or Spring Framework

<h3>Here are some helpful tips to make your Java learning journey more effective:</h3>

1. Practice Regularly
    - Consistent practice is key to mastering programming. Write code every day, even if it's just small programs
    - Build projects early on, even simple ones, to reinforce concepts.

2. Understand Concepts, Don't Just Memorize
    - Instead of memorizing syntax, focus on understanding why and how things work. For example, understand how for loops and while loops differ, or why this keyword is important in object-oriented programming

3. Break Problems into Smaller Parts
    - When facing a coding problem, break it into smaller, manageable chunks
    - Start by writing pseudocode or a plan of action for your solution, then translate it to Java

4. Learn to Read Error Messages
    - Java has descriptive error messages, which are helpful for debugging. Learn to read and understand them. If you don’t understand an error, search for it online—chances are, someone else has faced the same issue

5. Use IDE Features
    - Leverage your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for code completion, suggestions, and easy debugging. Both IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse have powerful tools to help you write and test Java code more effectively

6. Stay Patient
    - Learning a new language can feel overwhelming at first. Don’t rush or get discouraged by mistakes. Every mistake is an opportunity to learn

7. Join Communities
    - Join online forums, such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Java-focused groups. Asking questions and reading answers will deepen your understanding
